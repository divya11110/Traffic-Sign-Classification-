# Traffic-Sign-Classification-

In this project, we will train deep learning models known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify 43 traffic sign images. This project could be practically applied to self-driving cars. In this hands-on project we will go through the following tasks: (1) Import libraries and datasets (2) Images visualization (3) Convert images to gray-scale and perform normalization (4) Build deep learning model (5) Compile and train deep learning model (6) Assess trained model performance
